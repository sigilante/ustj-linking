<!--l. 52--><p class="noindent" >A compiled computer program is conventionally built by
parsing and compiling the source code into an object ﬁle and
then linking that object ﬁle to library code, yielding an
executable ﬁle. That linking can be accomplished in two ways:
either directly including all of the library code in the program
ﬁle, or supplying the library code in the operating system as a
service. Programmers have to balance ﬂexibility, portability,
and dependency management when deciding how to link a
program, but both approaches can still lead to practical
diﬃculties.

<!--l. 56--><p class="noindent" >“Static linking” includes all library code in the program
executable ﬁle. Static linking is the naïve way to combine
source ﬁles into a program: compound the ﬁles together into
one object and then compile that into a program. The
semantics tend to be clean and simple, and many programs
are linked this way. Statically-linked programs can also run
                                                
                                                
faster since they do not need to resolve library references
during execution.
</p><!--l. 58--><p class="indent" >   The problem with static linking is that if the same library
is used by more than one application, there is more than one
copy of it in memory as a result. This memory duplication can
be demanding on RAM utilization and reduce cache locality,
degrading overall system performance.
</p><!--l. 60--><p class="indent" >   Dynamic linking was invented to address this problem.
Instead of linking a library into a program at build time, one
links it at runtime. The OS keeps a single copy of the shared
library in RAM that multiple programs can use. This
reduces memory usage and improves performance, but
can lead to version mismatches and dependency issues. <a

     object concept itself is a towering failure. This
     is little appreciated but undeniably true. The
     idea of the shared object is simple enough: if
     you have a computer running lots of code, some
     of the code used will be the same. Why not just
     load it to memory once and share that memory
     at  runtime?  …  When  people  invented  shared
     objects back in the 1960s, the computer was a
     giant, rare thing ministered to by a priesthood:
     there was no such thing as multiple versions of
     a shared object. You used what the mainframe
     vendor sold you.

     Yum, SnapCraft…. As the number of packages
     grows,  this  breaks  down,  and  even  the  OS
     maintainers  are  giving  up  and  turning  to
     ﬂatpak, AppImages and Snap ﬁles. These are
     extremely complicated and incredibly wasteful

     a bunch of needed shared libraries with your

<!--l. 69--><p class="noindent" ><a 
 id="x1-3002"></a> Locklin’s picturesque exposition highlights the “dependency
hell” or “DLL hell” that mires modern software development
(cf. <a 
 id="x1-3003"></a> Grimes (2003)). From Urbit’s perspective as a solid-state
computer, another problem with dynamic linking is that it is
not deterministic. Dynamic linking was something of a pact
with the devil, permitting eﬃcient memory usage at the price
of legibility.

<!--l. 77--><p class="noindent" >Determinism has long been a desired characteristic of
any given build system. The source code should be a
function of build environment and build instructions in a
straightforward way. Even accessing the linked libraries in a
diﬀerent order can alter the resulting binary, however,
meaning that true reproducibility is elusive. Declarative
package managers like Nix (<a 
 id="x1-4001"></a> NixOS, 2024) and Guix (<a 
 id="x1-4002"></a>
GNU Guix, 2024) use a functional package management
approach to achieve reproducibility, marking packages using
cryptographic hashes to track dependencies uniquely and
repeatably.

(as text) into Nock code (as a binary tree). This process is
handled by <code class="lstinline"><span style="color:#000000">++rash</span></code>, <code class="lstinline"><span style="color:#000000">++mint:ut</span></code>, and other components of
the Urbit build system.
</p><!--l. 81--><p class="indent" >   Linking, in the Urbit sense, derives from supplying nouns to nouns at
compile time.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

 id="x1-4003f1"></a> 
In the Urbit build arm <code class="lstinline"><span style="color:#000000">++ford</span></code>, a pair of builds becomes the
build of a pair. The subject (environment) used to build a ﬁle is
the tuple <code class="lstinline"><span style="color:#000000">[</span><span style="color:#000000">import_n</span><span style="color:#000000"> </span>…<span style="color:#000000"> </span><span style="color:#000000">import_2</span><span style="color:#000000"> </span><span style="color:#000000">import_1</span><span style="color:#000000"> </span><span style="color:#000000">stdlib</span><span style="color:#000000">]</span></code>.
Since Hoon symbol lookup is left-to-right, this nests scopes
seamlessly and predictably. The linking technique is essentially
trivial.
</p><!--l. 83--><p class="indent" >   Ford compiles a Hoon source ﬁle into a data structure
called a “vase”, a pair <code class="lstinline"><span style="color:#000000">[</span><span style="color:#000000">type</span><span style="color:#000000"> </span><span style="color:#000000">noun</span><span style="color:#000000">]</span></code> where <code class="lstinline"><span style="color:#000000">noun</span></code> is a
member of the set of nouns described by <code class="lstinline"><span style="color:#000000">type</span></code>. Linking is
thence just calling the <code class="lstinline"><span style="color:#000000">++slop</span></code> funciton, a one-liner from a
pair of vases to a vase of the pair.
</p><!--l. 85--><p class="indent" >   For example, the (trivial) Hoon source ﬁle with text <code class="lstinline"><span style="color:#000000">&#x0027;</span><span style="color:#000000">3</span><span style="color:#000000">&#x0027;</span></code>

</p><!--l. 94--><p class="indent" >   This is a form of static linking. The linking is performed at
build time, not at runtime, and the resulting program contains
its imports. “Relocation pointers” in C correspond to
adjusting tree slots in Hoon, which the Hoon compiler does for
the developer. Because Urbit uses static linking, it long had
                                                
                                                
the same problem static linking has always had: memory
duplication. If two diﬀerent apps imported the same library,
that library would be built twice and two copies of it would
exist in memory.
</p><!--l. 96--><p class="indent" >   In Urbit, everything is a “noun” (a binary tree with
arbitrarily-sized integers at leaves). If you “copy” a noun <code class="lstinline"><span style="color:#000000">foo</span></code>,
like <code class="lstinline"><span style="color:#000000">[</span><span style="color:#000000">foo</span><span style="color:#000000"> </span><span style="color:#000000">foo</span><span style="color:#000000">]</span></code>, the runtime just copies a pointer to it. They
are immutable, so everything shares structure. Nouns are
“persistent” data structures, like Clojure’s collections. If
one copies a library, the copy is merely a pointer to the
library—the library is a <span 
class="ec-lmri-10">noun</span>. If an imported library can be
looked up from a build cache, the builder can copy it
into a new app’s build subject without duplicating it in
memory.
</p><!--l. 98--><p class="indent" >   But how does one know whether the cached library is
valid? To achieve global (cross-application) deduplication, one
needs a referentially transparent build cache, i.e. a build
factored as a full description of an input to the build system.
Since the build system is deterministic, if one sees the
same input, one knows that it will produce the same
output.
</p><!--l. 100--><p class="indent" >   With one referentially transparent cache for all builds in
the whole system, no invalidation is necessary. Cache eviction
can take place eﬃciently due to reference counting, since
which revisions of which apps refer to which builds is
known.
</p><!--l. 102--><p class="indent" >   As of <a 
 id="x1-4005"></a> <a 
href="#cite.0@Monk2022">#5745</a>, Urbit supplies such a referentially transparent
build cache. What this means in practice is that Urbit can
have the memory deduplication beneﬁts of dynamic linking
while still using static linking. Since every ﬁlesystem snapshot
lives at a unique, immutable, authenticated path within
Urbit’s scry namespace, reproducible builds are possible on
every node, a crucial feature for software supply chain security
and reliable app distribution.

<!--l. 106--><p class="noindent" >The  former  Ford  cache  was
per-desk,<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="mss3.html#fn2x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">2</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-5001f2"></a> 
keyed on the name of the build (e.g. a ﬁle at a certain path).
It was impossible to share such a cache between desks because
the name may refer to diﬀerent things on diﬀerent desks or at
diﬀerent revisions.
</p><!--l. 108--><p class="indent" >   Since the caches weren’t shared, they commonly held
exactly the same data but generated independently. For
instance, the same library used on diﬀerent desks would be
built repeatedly and the memory was not shared unless the
user manually ran the <code class="lstinline"><span style="color:#000000">|meld</span></code> command to manually
deduplicate nouns. For users with many apps installed, this
added signiﬁcant memory pressure.
</p><!--l. 110--><p class="indent" >   A new cache was designed which is keyed on the name of
the build plus its dependencies. This is all the input to a build
except the standard library. Thus when one matches a key it
does not matter which desk the value was on; the cache can be
shared across all desks. When the standard library changes, all
caches are cleared automatically.
</p><!--l. 112--><p class="indent" >   Reclaiming space from this cache becomes important.
Since this is a “true” cache, it’s never incorrect to keep data in
it. One could adopt a heuristic such as to clear hourly or
so you could use a heuristic such as &#x0022;clear the whole
thing every hour&#x0022; or a least-recently-used (LRU) policy.
However, <code class="lstinline"><span style="color:#000000">++ford</span></code> has a long history of trying to use such
heuristics and still using exorbitant amounts of memory. The
primary innovation of the former <code class="lstinline"><span style="color:#000000">++ford</span></code> cache was that its
size is deterministic, and it stored no builds unless they
could be generated from the head of its desk (<code class="lstinline"><span style="color:#000000">%home</span></code> then
<code class="lstinline"><span style="color:#000000">%base</span></code>).
</p><!--l. 114--><p class="indent" >   These properties are extended to the global cache by
counting references and maintaining a per-desk set of
references to builds which are still relevant to the head of that
desk. On every commit, the per-desk set of references
is inspected to determine which have been invalidated.
Invalidated references are freed in the usual manner—their
                                                
                                                
refcount is decremented, and if it’s now zero, then it is deleted
from the cache and all of its immediate dependencies are
freed.
</p><!--l. 116--><p class="indent" >   An alternative would be to garbage collect, which could be
done on every commit to maintain determinism. However, this
scales with the size of the cache (thus, with the number of
desks installed), whereas refcounting scales only with the desk
in question. Additionally, the cache is acyclic, and no
manual refcounting is required—there is precisely one place
where references are gained and one where references are
lost.
</p><!--l. 118--><p class="indent" >   As a result, the current cache has a “least upper bound”
property: ﬁrst, it minimizes the number of rebuilds required;
given that, it minimizes the amount of memory required. In
other words, cache entries are thrown away only when they
become irrelevant. An alternate approach would be a “greatest
lower bound”—throw away any cache entries that the system is
not certain to need. This uses a bit less memory but results in
more rebuilds. (It is also a little more complex to implement,
since it requires clients to “register” the builds they want to
keep warm in the cache, even if those builds didn’t become
invalid.)
</p><!--l. 120--><p class="indent" >   Generating a cache key for this cache can be slow—hundreds
of milliseconds is not uncommon, and it scales with the
number of transitive dependencies. To mitigate this, a
per-desk cache is included isomorphic to the former cache
system. This has sub-millisecond lookup speed, and remains
well-understood.

<!--l. 136--><p class="noindent" >Developers have long sought to balance the ﬂexibility and
portability of static linking with the better system demands of
dynamic linking. Despite care, the balancing act has
led from well-managed mainframe code into the current
linker spaghetti situation. Urbit’s <code class="lstinline"><span style="color:#000000">++ford</span></code> build system
elegantly solves for the linking problem by promoting
structural sharing of objects (nouns) in memory and by
utilizing a referentially transparent build cache across
desks. This balances eﬃciency in code compilation and
building with the reliability of solid-state computing.
